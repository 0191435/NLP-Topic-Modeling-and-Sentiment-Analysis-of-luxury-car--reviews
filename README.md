# -TOPIC-MODELING-AND-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-OF-LUXURY-CAR-BRAND-REVIEWS

# Introduction #

Natural Language Processing is a Machine Learning method used to teach computers how to understand the humanâ€™s natural language. It is not an easy task to teach these languages to computer but with the help of **NLP** process it possible for computer to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable. 

In machine learning and natural language processing, a **topic model** is a statistical model used for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents or in a corpus. A topic is a collection of dominant keywords that are typical meaning of the text

NLP could be used to extract topics from reviews, social media feeds, comments, articles, emails as well as user feedbacks. Understanding what customers are talking about in a particular product is very vital to companies especially e-commerce industry. However, since these online reviews are quite often overwhelming in terms of numbers and information, an intelligent system, capable of finding key insights (topics) from these reviews, will be of great help for both the customers and the cpmpanies. The goal of my project is to help cumtomer make decision when buying luxury cars and help these car brands to understand what their customers are saying and make some improvement on their products. 

I got a lot of inspiration from [this article](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/) and [this article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/10/mining-online-reviews-topic-modeling-lda/) by PRATEEK JOSHI

Some part of this project was based on [Alice Zhao](https://github.com/adashofdata/nlp-in-python-tutorial) project on Topic modeling and Sentiment Analysis

One of the most effect model of topic modeling is Gensim LDA model. In this project we will be using these 2 versions of gensim LDA model to see which one is the fastest computationally, provide meaningful topics and has the best coherence score:
*  **LDAMulticore**
*  **LDAMallet**

# Tools and Libraries used #
NLTK (Words tokenizer, stopwords and WordNetLemmatizer)
* Spacy
* Seaborn and Matplotlib
* Gensim libraries for Topic modeling
* TextBlob (sentiment analysis library)
* Pickle
* WordCloud
* Plotly
* Numpy and Pandas
* PyLDAViz

# Project Process #

* I got the datasets from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/ankkur13/edmundsconsumer-car-ratings-and-reviews)
   * load and merge the 5 dataset in one dataframe
   * check the data info,type, shape and null values
* Pre-processing
   * Remove null-values i.e rows with no reviews
   * Drop some unwanted columns
   * Do some feature engineering
   * Change the data type of some of the columns
   * Remove stop-words with NLTK
   * Remove number from text with regular expression function
   * lower the text and remove words lower than 3 letters
   * Bring the text back to base form by lemmatizing the text with Spacy
* EDA
    * Do some visualization, e.g wordcloud to uderstand the common words in the review
* LDA Model fitting for topic modeling 
   * Create a dictionatry and a corpus with the review text (the 2 are needed for the LDA models) 
   * Try out the 2 LDA models (LDAMulticore and LDAMallet) to see the one with the highest coherence score and with meaningful topics from the text
*  Sentiment Analysis
   * Do some feature engineering to get the sentiment in the reviews
   * Used TextBlob to derive the polarity and subjectivity in the reviews
   
* Visualization
   * Plot the the topics PyLDAviz
   * Use both plotly and Tableau to visualize the result of the sentiments
*  Communicate insights
   * Conclusion
   * Future work to improve the project
